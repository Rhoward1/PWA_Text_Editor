## Project Description
- This is a text editor that runs in the browser. The app is a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. This application is also able to function offline. The application first looks to use the data in the indexedDB to populate the editor, then if it cannot access that it will use local storage. For use offline, this application can be downloaded to your desktop as an application. This application is helpful to developers because they can use this as a scratch pad for code snippets and coding ideas.
